# Problem Statement
N-Queen Problem: How much compatible Queens can be placed on an NxN chessboard. (compatible: No one is under attack of others). \
N-Knight Problem: How much compatible Knights can be placed on an NxN chessboard (compatible: No one is under attack of others). \
The task is to find the maximum compatible queens or knights with Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO). \
In reality, the N-Queen Problem can be solved by Backtracking Algorithm, while the N-Knight Problem can be solved by observations and proved by induction.\
